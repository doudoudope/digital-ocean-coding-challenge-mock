# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A FastAPI REST API for asynchronous document ingestion and processing. 
Clients upload `.txt` files; a Celery worker processes them in
the background; results are retrieved via polling. Auth is API-key based with Redis-cached user
lookups and per-user daily upload quotas for free-tier users.

## Working Style

- **Think before coding.** State assumptions; if multiple interpretations exist, present them.
  When something is unclear, stop and ask.
- **Simplicity first.** Minimum code that solves the problem. No abstractions for single-use
  code, no flexibility that wasn't requested. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.
- **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Match existing style. Don't refactor
  what isn't broken. Every changed line should trace to the request.
- **Verify before claiming done.** Define a check before implementing — a test, a runnable
  command, a measurement. Loop until the check passes.
- **Small steps, documented.** Each meaningful change traces to a spec or decision record.
  If you can't write the spec, the change isn't ready.
- **Restructure top-down and end-to-end.** When moving, renaming, adding, or removing
  structure, trace the change from the repo root through every subproject and through the
  build/deploy path (Dockerfile, CI, Makefiles, configs, docs). Re-derive what the surrounding
  structure was *for* — if its reason no longer holds, remove it in the same pass. Don't leave
  orphaned root-level files, vestigial config, or stale build steps as follow-ups.

## Architecture

FastAPI + Celery + Redis + SQLAlchemy. Upload flow: `POST /documents` returns immediately with
`status: pending`; the worker processes asynchronously; clients poll
`GET /documents/{id}/status` or fetch `GET /documents/{id}/result` once complete.
